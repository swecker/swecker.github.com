        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <div>
            A Senior or Staff Engineering role allowing me to help create amazing things,
            mentor other engineers,
            provide architectural guidance,
            streamline (inter|intra)departmental processes,
            and reduce complexity across the business.
        </div>
        <h1>Qualification Summary</h1>
        <div>
            Over 10 years of engineering across front-end, full-stack, platform, and devops has given me a significant
            breadth of experience. I learn quickly and rapidly build an understanding of complex systems, at which
            point I work to significantly multiply system, team, and process efficacy.
        </div>
        <h1>Skill Summary</h1>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Coding</h4> - Deep knowledge and love for Elixir, Elixir's OTP, and functional programming paradigms

            <li>
                <h4>Front-End Web</h4> - Original development roots in pure HTML/CSS/JS, with lots of focus on design,
                templating, and css preprocessors. More recent experience using Vue and React.
            </li>
            <li><h4>Database Systems</h4> - Very experienced with SQL (mainly Postgres) and relational data models, and
                a passing proficiency with document-store databases (some Mongo, Cassandra, etc. but mostly Redis and

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Infrastructure</h4> -
                Extensive experience in maintaining resources in AWS, manually for many years, and more recently using
                Terraform and Kubernetes. Broad experience maintaining other DevOps tools like ArgoCD, Vault,
                self-hosted action runners, and leading infrastructure concerns such as autoscaling responsiveness and
                right-sizing resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Monitoring</h4> -
                Extensive background in integrating monitoring services like NewRelic and DataDog, as well as
                implementing standards such as Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and structured logging, all used in
                conjunction with self-hosted services like Grafana, Loki, ELK, etc.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li><h4>System Thinking</h4> -
                A profound understanding of the interoperability of large systems and distilling the complexity therein.
                Not only in complex software and its development process, but also in the human aspects of engineering,
                like team topologies and Conway's Law, as well as in the product concerns of translating business needs
                and user experiences.
